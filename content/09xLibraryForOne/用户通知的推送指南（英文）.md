Quick summary ↬ What are the benefits of using push notifications and what can you use them for? In this article, Lee Munroe explains how to implement them and which practices are best to follow.

I’ve spent the past several years building messaging tools — for more than three years now I’ve been leading the design team at [OneSignal](https://onesignal.com/), a customer engagement platform that enables developers and marketers to send transactional and promotional messages via push, in-app, email and SMS. I’ve learned a lot about how messaging works including the pros and cons of using push to communicate with your audience. In this post, I’ll brain dump all of my knowledge on the topic.

## Introduction To Push [#](#introduction-to-push)

Push notifications are clickable messages that pop up on your phone or desktop with some content. Typical types of push notifications include:

-   **Promotional**  
    New blog post, new release, a Black Friday sale, etc.
-   **Transactional**  
    New message received, a friend liked your comment, your driver is on their way, appointment reminders, etc.

Push notifications were originally introduced in 2009 by Apple with [APNs](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/APNSOverview.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008194-CH8-SW1) (Apple Push Notification service). Google quickly followed for Android (which later became [FCM](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging)) and in 2013 web push was introduced for Chrome.

Push is still a relatively new communication technology compared to its siblings. The [first email](https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/60at60/2015/8/1971-first-ever-email-392973) was **sent in 1971** (50 years ago!) and the first SMS was **sent in 1992** (30 years ago!). Marketers and developers are still discovering where push fits into their communication stack, so while most companies have an email strategy for customer engagement, most don’t have a push strategy yet.

[![A picture of the first SMS](https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/068ed38c-194b-4e7b-b231-11c72d6d14da/13-guide-push-notifications-developers.png)](https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/068ed38c-194b-4e7b-b231-11c72d6d14da/13-guide-push-notifications-developers.png)

Push is very similar to these other communication channels like email. You use them to **engage** with your customers. You can send **promotional** or **transactional** content. You need a way for people to **opt-in and opt-out**. You need to **segment** your audiences. You need to **personalize** your messages. You need to **compose** your message, **send** your message, view **reporting** for your message, and so on.

## Why Use Push Notifications? [#](#why-use-push-notifications)

There are several benefits of push over other messaging channels:

-   Push typically sees **higher engagement than email** — [20% open rate vs 2%](https://reckless.agency/insight/email-vs-push-notifications-vs-in-app-messaging-which-has-the-highest-engagement/);
-   Push **doesn’t require** users to hand over any **personal information** like an email address or phone number;
-   Push is **cheap** to send (unlike SMS which is upwards of 2c per message);
-   Push is **quick** to send;
-   Push has a **high opt-in** rate (see more below).

What can you use push notifications for?

-   **Abandoned cart**  
    Get users back to complete the checkout process.
-   **Onboarding**  
    Welcome users to your app and get them up and running.
-   **Announcements**  
    New features, updates, and upcoming events.
-   **Offers**  
    Discounts and rewards.
-   **Rewards & delight**  
    Make users feel good with rewarding progress in a game.
-   **Live updates**  
    News, scores, order status.

## How To Implement Push Notifications [#](#how-to-implement-push-notifications)

You can build your own push service on top of the different APIs and operating system platforms available. iOS has [APNs](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/APNSOverview.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008194-CH8-SW1). Google has [FCM](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/concept-options). Web browsers use [Service Workers](https://caniuse.com/serviceworkers), [Notification API](https://caniuse.com/mdn-api_notification) and the [Push API](https://caniuse.com/push-api). When building your own you need to consider the push service, managing subscribers, permission prompts, message composition, delivery and reporting.

[![Beginners guide to web push notifications using service workers](https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/65e19204-65f0-48b7-94d9-c958e46e448b/7-guide-push-notifications-developers.png)](https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/65e19204-65f0-48b7-94d9-c958e46e448b/7-guide-push-notifications-developers.png)

[Beginners guide to web push notifications using service workers](https://medium.com/@a7ul/beginners-guide-to-web-push-notifications-using-service-workers-cb3474a17679). ([Large preview](https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/65e19204-65f0-48b7-94d9-c958e46e448b/7-guide-push-notifications-developers.png))

Unless you’re a big company with a full team of engineers you can dedicate to maintaining such a service, you should **just use a push service that exists**. Just like you’re unlikely to build your own internal email service, the same applies to push.

As push APIs are updated with each **new iOS or Android release**, it makes sense to let a service provider do the heavy lifting here **so you’re not left maintaining that system**. There are services that offer easy-to-use UIs, SDKs and APIs. Some of the best push notification providers for developers and marketers include:

-   [OneSignal](http://onesignal.com/),
-   [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging),
-   [Amazon SNS](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/?whats-new-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.postDateTime&whats-new-cards.sort-order=desc),
-   [Pusher](https://pusher.com/),
-   [Braze](https://www.braze.com/).

## Aren’t Push Notifications Annoying? [#](#aren-t-push-notifications-annoying)

They absolutely can be, yes. Just like sending irrelevant emails or too many text messages is annoying and spam. This is not a fault of the technology itself, but we as website owners and app developers abusing their power.

For example, a lot of websites or apps immediately prompt users to subscribe to push. This is just as frustrating as a blog you land on immediately surfacing a pop-up asking you to subscribe to their email newsletter. At this point, you have no idea what they do or if there’s value in subscribing.

[![An example of a website which immediately prompts users to subscribe to push and to their email newsletter](https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/0db68577-61d2-4459-bd86-da3e8bb9e2b7/28-guide-push-notifications-developers.png)](https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/0db68577-61d2-4459-bd86-da3e8bb9e2b7/28-guide-push-notifications-developers.png)

[![An example of native prompt on macOS Chrome](https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/f7add810-00ed-43b7-b451-7dd58245c936/5-guide-push-notifications-developers.png)](https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/f7add810-00ed-43b7-b451-7dd58245c936/5-guide-push-notifications-developers.png)

Don’t do this. Treat your app users and website visitors with respect. In fact, browsers have [started clamping down](https://blog.mozilla.org/en/products/firefox/block-notification-requests/) on websites that do this, and instead hide the prompt until the user notices it and clicks on it.

## Prompting Best Practices [#](#prompting-best-practices)

Permission opt-ins differ across operating systems and industries:

-   **iOS**  
    Users must explicitly opt-in for push when they download your app, the **average opt-in rate ranges 35–45%**.
-   **Android**  
    Users are automatically opted in to receive push notifications, the **average opt-in rate ranges 35–45%**.
-   **Web push**  
    Users must explicitly opt-in for push when they visit your website, the **average opt-in rate ranges 7–17%**.

Only prompt users to subscribe after they have had an opportunity to find value e.g. after at least 1 pageview, or after they have taken an action where it would be useful for them to know when there’s an update.

[![Soft prompts for Washington Post, Amazon Kindle, Twitter](https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/1e678fcf-7e8e-47b4-a252-513aba61d44b/3-guide-push-notifications-developers.png)](https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/1e678fcf-7e8e-47b4-a252-513aba61d44b/3-guide-push-notifications-developers.png)

**Use soft prompts.** You only have one opportunity to ask users with the native prompt, after which it is painful to ask them to go into settings and allow you to send them messages. Use your one opportunity wisely.

[![Example of soft prompt from Slack that triggers the browser native prompt](https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/42cf7b76-e1c4-4306-a529-5b39c3c2a8d7/2-guide-push-notifications-developers.png)](https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/42cf7b76-e1c4-4306-a529-5b39c3c2a8d7/2-guide-push-notifications-developers.png)

### Asking For Permission Immediately [#](#asking-for-permission-immediately)

[![A screenshot where ‘app’ asks to send notifications](https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/5b35dc3b-dc2c-4e41-b640-e81759fbe168/19-guide-push-notifications-developers.png)](https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/5b35dc3b-dc2c-4e41-b640-e81759fbe168/19-guide-push-notifications-developers.png)

Asking to send notifications right away. No, thank you. ([Large preview](https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/5b35dc3b-dc2c-4e41-b640-e81759fbe168/19-guide-push-notifications-developers.png))

Don’t do this. Allow users to experience your app or website first and the value you provide. Delay your prompt at least a pageview or by some time so users have an opportunity to look around. Or wait until the user is taking action and then present them with an option to subscribe.

### Not Telling Users What Notifications Will Contain [#](#not-telling-users-what-notifications-will-contain)

Make users aware of the value of your push notifications. Will they notify me of new sales and promotions? When someone sends me a message? When there’s a new blog post? Make it clear so users can decide if these are the types of messages they want to receive.

### Don’t Make It Hard To Opt-out [#](#don-t-make-it-hard-to-opt-out)

Allow users to edit their notification preferences within the app. Just like an email preference center, users may want to unsubscribe from all notifications or a certain category of notification e.g. stop sending me every blog update but do send me new feature announcements.

### Don’t Send Too Many Notifications [#](#don-t-send-too-many-notifications)

Set expectations upfront on how often you expect to send notifications. Then stick to that. Depending on what industry you’re in this could be many per day e.g. breaking news alerts, or once a week e.g. meditation app.

[![NYTimes allows users to customize their notification preferences](https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/b5e194a0-81b4-4574-940c-257345eb326f/25-guide-push-notifications-developers.png)](https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/b5e194a0-81b4-4574-940c-257345eb326f/25-guide-push-notifications-developers.png)

## Sending Best Practices [#](#sending-best-practices)

Don’t just carelessly blast push notifications to all your subscribers. Consider who your users are, their context, and the value they will get from your content and service.

[![A screenshot of a promotional notification with emoji and photo from Joe Coffee](https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/ff5d0f12-fc56-4e45-b4f3-99dcb0f6ebe4/joe-ios-notification.png)](https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/ff5d0f12-fc56-4e45-b4f3-99dcb0f6ebe4/joe-ios-notification.png)

-   Messages should be **timely, relevant, and precise**.
-   Use **emojis**, they tend to help CTR.
-   Make sure your content is **valuable**.
-   **Personalize**, use the subscriber’s name or something relevant to them.
-   Use **urgency** and **fomo** to help increase CTRs on things like sales.
-   **A/B test** to see what content and images perform better.
-   **Segment** based on **user behavior** or **preferences** e.g. geographic location, level of engagement.
-   Schedule per **user’s timezone**, make sure they don’t receive messages in the middle of the night.
-   Keep the **content short and concise**, and get to the point.

## Analytics and ROI [#](#analytics-and-roi)

Numbers you want to keep an eye on:

-   **Opt-in rate**  
    Percentage of users or visitors that are opting in to push, adjust your message, or when you are promoting to improve this.
-   **Deliverability**  
    How many messages actually got delivered to user devices.
-   **Open rate**  
    The number of messages that were clicked divided by the messages sent.
-   **Outcome/goal/conversion**  
    What was the end goal, e.g. a purchase or plan upgrade? Opt-in rates and open rates are often considered vanity metrics, what you really care about is did they produce an outcome.

For web push, use [UTMs](https://ga-dev-tools.web.app/ga4/campaign-url-builder/) to help track attribution. For mobile push, services like [AppsFlyer](https://www.appsflyer.com/) and [Branch](https://branch.io/) can help with attribution tracking.

## Why Am I or My Users Not Receiving Push Notifications? [#](#why-am-i-or-my-users-not-receiving-push-notifications)

Here are some of the most common reasons I’ve seen.

### Users Haven’t Subscribed To Your App [#](#users-haven-t-subscribed-to-your-app)

Ask them to subscribe. Check that they are subscribed. Look up their user’s ID you’ve defined or push token.

### Users Have Turned Off Notifications For Your App Or Website [#](#users-have-turned-off-notifications-for-your-app-or-website)

Ask users to check their app settings or browser settings and ensure they haven’t blocked you.

### Users Have Turned Off Notifications For The Browser They Are Using [#](#users-have-turned-off-notifications-for-the-browser-they-are-using)

Or they never gave it (the browser) permission in the first place. Operating systems will ask users permission to send notifications via their browsers, and often users will ignore these. Ask them to check their app level notification settings in their OS.

### Users Have Turned Off Notifications For The OS They Are Using [#](#users-have-turned-off-notifications-for-the-os-they-are-using)

Some users will turn off all notifications for their OS, intentionally or accidentally. Check their OS settings for notifications. For example, `Settings` > `Notifications` > `Show Previews` > `Never` will turn off all iOS notifications.

[![A screenshot with settings 'show previews when unlocked'](https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/1fbdf14b-7f42-43aa-9235-9d735e72d0b4/27-guide-push-notifications-developers.png)](https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/1fbdf14b-7f42-43aa-9235-9d735e72d0b4/27-guide-push-notifications-developers.png)

Check settings at your OS level, browser level, and app level to ensure notifications are turned on and you or they have opted in.

## The Future of Push Notifications [#](#the-future-of-push-notifications)

### iOS Support For Web Push [#](#ios-support-for-web-push)

**Web push for iOS Safari** has been in high demand for years and recently it looks like they might be ready to give in with a [recent update to WebKit](https://onesignal.com/blog/ios-web-push-notification-support-is-coming-soon/). This will be huge if Apple has decided to finally enable this.

[![A screenshot with Experimental WebKit Features](https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/0acf3d54-0862-4921-ae83-46093f1ab4c0/8-guide-push-notifications-developers.png)](https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/0acf3d54-0862-4921-ae83-46093f1ab4c0/8-guide-push-notifications-developers.png)

### Android Opt-In [#](#android-opt-in)

Starting with **Android 13**, users will have to [opt-in to receive notifications](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2022/03/second-preview-android-13.html). There is likely no meaningful long-term effect on opt-in rates, but it will improve the overall ecosystem by giving users control up-front, rather than having to opt-out later.

[![Android opt-in](https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/0f958371-c5db-440a-b31a-c1c92852f9fd/26-guide-push-notifications-developers.png)](https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/0f958371-c5db-440a-b31a-c1c92852f9fd/26-guide-push-notifications-developers.png)

### Omnichannel Messaging [#](#omnichannel-messaging)

Omnichannel and more integration alongside other messaging channels. Every user has a preference for how they receive messages, and it is important to consider this when personalizing that **customer journey with push, email, SMS**.

[![A graph of omnichannel messaging](https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_80/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/9e85ab0f-2ce8-4e2c-b1be-d7a452fb4559/15-guide-push-notifications-developers.png)](https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/9e85ab0f-2ce8-4e2c-b1be-d7a452fb4559/15-guide-push-notifications-developers.png)

In 2022 it’s even more important to consider your user’s behavior across all these channels, ensuring you **automate your messaging and extend your reach** across all channels.

### Preventing Abuse [#](#preventing-abuse)

Browsers and operating systems are working hard to prevent abuse e.g. making sure websites don’t show prompts immediately to visitors. As mentioned previously, some updates have already been shipped here recently with Chrome, Firefox and Edge to [hide prompts on websites](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/chrome-firefox-browser-notifications) that are immediately prompting on page load, and there is sure to be more to follow.

Firefox hides the native prompt behind a wiggling speech bubble.

## Conclusion [#](#conclusion)

If you run a website or app today and you’re not sending push notifications, you should add it. If you’re already sending email, SMS or in-app, you should add push to your stack. As long as you make sure the content is valuable and follow the best practices above, it’s an opportunity for you to re-engage and your users will be grateful.
